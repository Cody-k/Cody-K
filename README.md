As a Database Analyst with a robust background in data quality management, process improvement, and strategic financial planning, I excel in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive efficiency and informed decision-making. With experience spanning both corporate health-tech and military finance environments, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and leadership skills.

In my current role, I've led projects that enhanced data structures and optimized team workflows, reducing costs and improving productivity. My technical proficiency with tools like Tableau, AWS Redshift, Python, and SQL has enabled me to develop robust data models and interactive dashboards that support key business functions and provide leaders with critical KPIs.

During my tenure as a Captain in the United States Marine Corps, I managed large teams and substantial budgets, streamlined financial processes, and ensured accurate and timely disbursements. My leadership experience in high-pressure environments both in garrison and deployed has honed my ability to deliver results and drive team success.

I am passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems and enhance organizational performance. Currently, I am preparing to further my expertise with an MBA.
